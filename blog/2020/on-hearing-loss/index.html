  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As a departure from the existing posts here focused on neuroimaging and programming, I want to take time to share my experience of being in academia my congenital hearing loss.</p>

<h3 id="living-with-an-invisible-disability">Living with an invisible disability</h3>

<p>I was born with moderate sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and have worn hearing aids since the age of three. I can’t imagine a life with normal hearing; my hearing loss has fundamentally shaped who I am today and how I approach my life.</p>

<p>One of the biggest double-edged swords of hearing loss is that it’s easily hidden–i.e. invisible. For one, hearing aids are often designed to be discrete; it’s nice to wear a hearing aid that is neatly tucked away in the ear canal, matched to your skin tone, etc. Furthermore, an individual with hearing loss may have learned to cope so well that their disability initially flies under the radar.</p>

<p>Although convenient, invisibility can prevent others from recognizing the disability and adjusting in their behaviour accordingly. Invisibility can also make it easy to forget that someone has hearing loss, so the accommodating behaviours that were once in place are subsequently forgotten by even the most well-intentioned peers.</p>

<p>Because of this, I’ve become very proactive about my hearing loss. I regularly rely on a number strategies to workaround my hearing in order to function close-to-normal. A great example is ‘hearing with my eyes’. I’m always reading lips to some degree, and, when I can, I try to position myself so that I can see the speaker’s face when they’re talking. I also pay close attention to people’s speaking habits so that I can familiarize myself with their voice.</p>

<p>I also rely on situational awareness. I always take a quick visual scan each time I enter an unfamiliar room in order to build some expectations of sounds I might have trouble recognizing and localizing when my head is turned away (e.g., blinds clicking up against an open window on a windy day). Or, I simply position myself so that I’m always facing the room, mafia-style. Seeing-to-hear is a neverending exercise, so much so that I can’t imagine <em>not</em> doing this.</p>

<p>I will also mention my hearing loss to someone if I am struggling to hear them, and I kindly remind people about it when necessary. Admittedly, it took years to be comfortable being upfront with my hearing loss, but this is a skill that has paid off in spades. With a few exceptions, people are pretty understanding.</p>

<h3 id="academia-and-hearing-loss">Academia and hearing loss</h3>

<p>My hearing loss impacts my experience as a grad student. Not so much the day-to-day, as I’m mostly parked in front of my computer coding up analyses, but rather situations like conferences and talks.</p>

<p>Conferences, despite how much I enjoy them, pose the biggest challenges. Poster sessions are arguably one of the best parts of academia; I’ve met a lot of wonderful people and have had some of my favourite conversations in front of posters. For pretty much everyone, poster sessions are invaluable.</p>

<p>However, poster sessions are essentially <em>worst-case scenarios</em> for someone with hearing loss. Deafening amount of background noise? Check. Lots of unfamiliar voices? Check. Crowds of people that create distance from you and the speaker? Check. The list goes on. The best solution I’ve found is to go poster-hopping with a colleague and check with eachother after each poster.</p>

<p>Talks are hit or miss because it all depends the speaker and venue. The worst thing a speaker can do is refuse to use a microphone. I’ve seen a few speakers justify the mic-refusal, even when asked to use one, by saying that they “don’t know how to use a mic” or “don’t like mics”; it’s a shame to see someone more concerned about themselves than what they’re actually there for–to effectively share their science and ideas. But I digress.</p>

<p>The best talks for me tend to be the best talks for everyone. That is, a speaker who is well-prepared and practiced. Practice is particularly important, as rambling or improvising can sometimes result in poorer annunciation and confusion. For this reason, I personally try to rehearse my own talks <em>ad-nauseam</em> beforehand. I also find the use of repetition and sign-posting particularly helpful, as they help orient the listener and emphasize the main points.</p>

<p>I enjoy when a speaker has slides with some text on it, so that I can read, rather than hear, the key details. However, I understand that text can be also be distracting when it’s too much, or annoying when the speaker is just reading off the text entirely. If you’re not one to include any text in your slides, then my recommendation is to include a couple of brief text-based summary slides at throughout the talk.</p>

<p>Additionally, speakers who repeat questions from the audience are truly the unsung heroes of academia. Even in small rooms or when the audience member asking the question has a microphone, repeating the question is a great way for a speaker to confirm that a) they themselves, and b) the audience, heard correctly. If it sounds artificial or forced to repeat questions, just know that a lot of people already naturally do this when they begin to think about an answer.</p>

<p>Finally, when giving my own talks, I <em>always</em> start the question period by telling the audience that a) I am hearing impaired, and b) I may ask them to repeat the question more than once. In some instances, I’ve literally walked right up to the audience member to hear them. Do what you gotta do.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">tl;dr</h3>

<p>Like most occupations, academia poses some challenges for individuals with hearing loss. That said, I’m fortunate enough to say that hearing loss hasn’t really gotten in the way of my education or career. As I’ve described above, the challenges that come with being in academia are often addressed or overcome by being upfront, patient, and proactive. In fact, that’s probably helpful for pretty much anything in life.</p>
