title: "Time-to-overwhelm: A KPI for big projects"

Lately I've been pitching an idea to colleagues that pertains to big and complicated projects. In my own work, it's an idea that I've found useful for navigating the scope and stages of a problem I've been working on. The core thesis is as follows: Solving important problems inevitably leads to feeling some degree of being overwhelmed, and critically, the earlier this feeling occurs in the project, the better. Let's elaborate.

To state the obvious as a loose rule, big and important problems are inherently overwhelming due to their greater complexity, aperture, and impact than simple problems. You *will* be overwhelmed at some point, so the trick is to have some agency over *when* you'll be overwhelmed.

The process of a) scoping out and recognizing the challenges that lie ahead, b) identifying the problem's knowns and unknowns, and c) mapping out the problem's the depth and breadth, is a crucial step in a project's development. This process, however, is overwhelming. Therefore, we can treat the sense of being overwhelmed as a indicator of how extensively a project is mapped out. The sooner this state is achieved, the better. A fast time-to-overwhelm is exactly what you want, making it a not-too-serious, and subjective, key performance indicator (KPI).

Contrast this to getting overwhelmed late in a project. Deadlines aside, if this occurs late in the project, it's probably because one or more of a-c in the previous paragraph were underestimated at the start. Suddenly becoming aware of just how complicated and deep the problem you're working on, *while you're knee deep in it*, brings a different, more dreaded, sense of overwhelmed--you're both too far in and too far out.

Another obvious yet important point: Experience and expertise is critical for scoping and planning a project out. Therefore, assembling a team with diverse perspectives and backgrounds, with multiple avenues of expertise, is crucial for a fast time-to-overwhelm. An added bonus here is that being collectively overwhelmed together is a lot more enjoyable than being overwhelmed alone.
