I recently submitted my PhD thesis and I now impatiently wait the agonizing four weeks until my thesis defence. The 275-page tome is titled *The human brain in action: Coordination among neural systems for planning and adapting movements*, and it proved itself to be some of the hardest work I've ever done. I'm grateful for this experience, and the gruelling writing process pushed me to better myself both as a scientist and as an individual. 

There was no shortage of wonderful advice from friends and colleagues over the course of the last several months as I completed the thesis--there was no shortage of sympathy either. I've since done a lot of reflection on the entire process, and now want to share some thoughts that I've increasingly come to recognize and appreciate. 

1. Embrace the suck. I forget where I first heard this phrase, but I found myself often repeating this to myself as I worked late into the night or felt stress levels rise. A PhD thesis is a privilege, full stop. The hard work that it entails and the stress that it brings are privileges. The personal growth that you experience during the process is a privilege. To not fully embrace the suck is to take this incredible opportunity for granted.
2. I was lucky enough that 2/3 chapters already published, and the remaining chapter in preprint. Because of this, I was confident on the scientific quality of my thesis, and instead could just focus on writing the literature review and general discussion. I realize this is a fairly rare position to be in, and takes a lot of upfront work in the years leading up to the grand finale, but the more you can position yourself to already have proven your data in the court of science, the more straightforward the writing process will be. 
3. Don't overdo the writing. Few people will read it, and no one will read it more closely than yourself. This is probably a frustration to some, and a relief to others. But the focus is on the science, not the prose.
4. Writer's block doesn't exist. This is one of my favourite perspectives from [Cal Newport](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/ep-21-taming-writers-block-the-exaggerated-importance/id1515786216?i=1000488994833). The fighting to get words on paper, the many rewrites and restructuring, and the maddening feeling of frustration that we conventionally interpret as experiencing "writer's block" *is* the process of writing. Recognizing this reframes the process to keep stress levels in check, and ensures that you don't hold yourself to an unrealistic standard in which writing is always some magical flow state. Refer to point 1. 
5. If you think your thesis isn't good enough, or if you're disapointed with the final product, *it is good enough*. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. There is no such thing as a perfect thesis and you're not trying to save the world with it. It certainly feels like some sort of grand finale--the supposed apex of your intellectual accomplishments--and therefore feels like it has to be perfect. But, the reality is that your thesis is one of many incredible things you will accomplish in your life, inside or outside of science. It's not the finale, it's the start.
