I had an old T1w scan of mine kicking around (who doesn't?) and I wondered if I could turn into it semi-artistic icon for Slack, etc. Because why not?

I figured the easiest approach would be to run a Canny filter to generate a binary brain trace, which could then be smoothed and stylized for artistic effect. This is all done with a simple function:

```python
def make_brain_trace(fname, out, figsize=(8, 8)):
    """Converts image of a brain slice to an artistic binary trace  

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : str
        Input image filename.
    out : str
        Output filename. If no extension is provided, file will be saved 
        as a .png
    figsize : tuple, optional
        Size of the output image in (height, width), by default (8, 10)
    """
    img = mpimg.imread(fname)[:, :, 0]
    img = feature.canny(img).astype(float)
    
    # upsample to smooth out lines
    img = transform.rescale(img, 6, multichannel=False)
    img = np.where(img > .7, 1, 0)

    # create image
    plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    plt.imshow(img, cmap='binary')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.savefig(out, dpi=300)
```

So, all I did was take a screenshot of my (skull-stripped) brain and run it through the function. You can see the before and after below: 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/brain_art.png">

Not bad!
