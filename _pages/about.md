I am a PhD student in the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University, as a member of the [Memory, Action, and Perception Lab](http://www.gallivanmaplab.com/) and the [Cognition and Action Lab](http://www.flanaganlab.com/). My research uses fMRI to understand how the human motor system interacts with various cognitive systems in order to guide goal-behaviour, such as interacting with objects and learning new motor skills. Understanding the processes that govern our motor system not only helps us appreciate how we move about our world in everyday life, but can also guide treatment for neurological disorders and help develop intelligent robotics, such as neural prosthetics.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for Desid Labs, a small Calgary-based startup to build web applications for healthcare clients. I completed my Bachelors of Science at Queen's University in 2015, where I studied Psychology and Biology.

Outside of research, I am interested in data science and software development. I work on open source [software]() and have provided analysis and consulting for local non-profit organizations through [Data For Good](https://dataforgood.ca/).
