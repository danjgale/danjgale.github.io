I am a PhD student in the [Memory, Action, and Perception](http://www.gallivanmaplab.com/) and the [Cognition and Action](http://www.flanaganlab.com/) labs at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University. 

I use functional MRI to explore how the brain's motor system interacts with cognitive and sensory systems in order to guide goal-directed actions. Understanding the processes that govern our motor system not only helps us appreciate how we move about our world in everyday life, but can also guide treatment for neurological disorders and help develop intelligent robotics, such as neural prosthetics.

I also have an interest in data science and software development. Check out the Software page or my [Github](https://github.com/danjgale) for some ongoing projects.
