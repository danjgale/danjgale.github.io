I am Data Scientist with [VoxelAI](https://www.voxel.ai/) and a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the [Centre for Neuroscience Studies](https://neuroscience.queensu.ca/) at Queen's University. As an expert in MRI data analysis and scientific software development, I build state-of-the-art brain imaging platforms and conduct analyses to quantify changes in brain function throughout the lifespan and in experimental contexts.
