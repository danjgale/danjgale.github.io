I am a PhD candidate in the [Memory, Action, and Perception](http://www.gallivanmaplab.com/) and the [Cognition and Action](http://www.flanaganlab.com/) labs at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University. 

My research uses functional MRI to study how the brain's sensory and motor systems interact in order to guide basic movements, as well as how how these interactions change as a result of learning new tasks. I also develop data pipelines for both human and non-human primate neuroimaging, and build [open source software](/software).
