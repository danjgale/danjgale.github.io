I am Data Scientist with [VoxelAI](https://www.voxel.ai/) and a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the [Centre for Neuroscience Studies](https://neuroscience.queensu.ca/) at Queen's University. I have deep expertise in MRI data analysis and scientific software development; across my roles in research and technology, I build state-of-the-art brain imaging platforms in order to study changes in brain function over time.
