I am a PhD student in the [Memory, Action, and Perception](http://www.gallivanmaplab.com/) and the [Cognition and Action](http://www.flanaganlab.com/) labs at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University. 

My research uses functional MRI to explore how the brain's motor system engages with sensory and cognitive systems during motor learning and object-directed actions. I am also interested in developing [open source software](/software) for neuroimaging and beyond.
