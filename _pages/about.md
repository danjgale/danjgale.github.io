I am a Data Scientist with [VoxelAI](https://www.voxel.ai/) and a Research Associate with the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University. Across both roles, I develop state-of-the-art brain imaging platforms for clinical and research purposes.

I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at Queen's University under the supervision of [Dr. Jason Gallivan](http://www.gallivanmaplab.com/) and [Dr. Randy Flanagan](http://www.flanaganlab.com/). For fun, I build [open source software](/software) for analyzing and visualizing brain imaging data.
