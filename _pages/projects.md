## Software

### Niimasker

[Niimasker](https://github.com/danjgale/nii-masker) is a simple command-line tool that extracts and post-processes fMRI data. This tool is a wrapper around [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/index.html), a powerful Python package for fMRI data analysis. It has a simple command-line interface and allows for easy configuration with a JSON file. Thus, Niimasker extends Nilearn's capabilities to non-Python users. As well, Niimasker provides visual reports for quality assessments, and fully documents the extraction and processing steps to improve reproducibility and transparancy.

### Voxelwise

A project very much in early development, [Voxelwise](https://github.com/danjgale/voxelwise) is a Python package that makes it easy to perform Multivariate Pattern Analysis with fMRI data. It provides convenient classes to model and extract voxel patterns, and run a full decoding analysis with a comprehensive visual report. Under the hood, Voxelwise relies on Nilearn and Scikit-Learn.
