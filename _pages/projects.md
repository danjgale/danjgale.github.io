## Software

### Niimasker

[Niimasker](https://github.com/danjgale/nii-masker) is a simple commandline tool that extracts and post-processes fMRI data. This tool is a wrapper around [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/index.html), a powerful Python package for fMRI data analysis, and thus extends Nilearn's capabilities to non-Python users. As well, Niimasker provides visual reports for quality assessments, and fully documents the extraction and processing steps to improve reproducibility and transparancy.
