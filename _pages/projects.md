## Software

### Bidsconv

[bidsconv](https://danjgale.github.io/bidsconv/) is a tool developed for the MAP lab's centralized fMRI pipeline. It converts raw DICOM files to a full [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) dataset, ensuring that our data is consistently organized from project to project. 

### Niimasker

[Niimasker](https://github.com/danjgale/nii-masker) is a simple command-line tool that extracts and post-processes fMRI data. This tool is a wrapper around [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/index.html), a Python package for fMRI data analysis, with some extra bells and whistles.
### Voxelwise

[Voxelwise](https://github.com/danjgale/voxelwise) is a Python package in its early stages that makes it easy to perform multivariate pattern analysis with fMRI data.
