## Software

These software projects are largely motivated by gaps I indentify in my lab's analysis pipelines. They serve to address these gaps, but also aim to be useful to anyone in general.

### Bidsconv

[bidsconv](https://danjgale.github.io/bidsconv/) is a convenient wrapper around [dcm2bids](https://cbedetti.github.io/Dcm2Bids/) for DICOM to [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) conversions in our lab. This tool ensures that our data is consistently organized from project to project. 

### Niimasker

[Niimasker](https://github.com/danjgale/nii-masker) is a simple command-line tool that extracts and post-processes fMRI data. This tool is a built around [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/index.html), a Python package for fMRI data analysis, with some extra bells and whistles. 

### Voxelwise

[Voxelwise](https://github.com/danjgale/voxelwise) is a Python package in its early stages that simplifies multivariate pattern analysis with fMRI data. It aims to provide everything you need for an end-to-end analysis.  

### wb_sanity

[wb_sanity](https://github.com/danjgale/wb_sanity) is a collection of functions that make deriving simple, everyday surface visualizations with [Connectome Workbench](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench) a little less cumbersome. 


## Open Source Involvement

In addition to my own projects, I also contribute to the following projects:

- [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/index.html)
- [AtlasReader](https://github.com/miykael/atlasreader)
