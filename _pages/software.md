## Software

### Surfplot

[surfplot](https://github.com/danjgale/surfplot) is a Python package for plotting publication-ready brain surfaces figures (e.g., statistical maps, parcellations). Users can easily add plotting layers, customize figure styling, and integrate plots into existing matplotlib workflows. See [documentation](https://surfplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more detail.
 
### Reg-fusion

[Reg-fusion](https://github.com/danjgale/reg-fusion) is a Python package that accurately projects MRI data in standard volumetric space (e.g., MNI space) to the *fsaverage* cortical surface for data analysis and visualization. It is a pure-Python implementation of the highly accurate registration fusion approach described [Wu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24213).
